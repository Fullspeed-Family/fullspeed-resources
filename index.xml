TrackMania a game that is quite simple to understand. You control a car that is placed at the start line of a track, and your only inputs are forward, backwards and left/right steering. Every car is the same, they behave, accelerate, break all the same. The track gives you a route, and your goal is to drive to the finish line as fast as possible.</description></item><item><title>Input Device</title><link>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/input-device/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:15:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/input-device/</guid><description>The most common input devices used in Fullspeed are keyboard and gamepad/controller. What you use typically does not matter. There are top players that use both keyboard and gamepad, who are all very consistent and can drive very fast times.
When chosing an input device for fullspeed, you should go with the one you feel the most comfortable with.
While the differences between keyboard and gamepad are neglectible in practice, there are a few differences that are worth knowing about.</description></item><item><title>Your Speed</title><link>https://fsfam.club/resources/basics/your-speed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:29:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fsfam.club/resources/basics/your-speed/</guid><description>Speed is propotional to time. The more speed you have, the less time is needed to move from point A to point B. In Fullspeed, your speed is almost the deterministic factor for how well you are driving and the final result. Because you don&amp;rsquo;t slow down in Fullspeed, you can think of the track as 1 big straight line, and the more speed you have the faster you get to the finish.</description></item><item><title>Graphics</title><link>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/graphics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:22:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/graphics/</guid><description>Since Fullspeed is such a high-speed and intensive style to play, having good frame rate will be quite important as it helps with reaction times and seeing what is coming at you in the track.
Under Settings -&amp;gt; Graphics you will find all settings related to the graphics of the game.
Shader Quality One of the most impactful options on your FPS is the &amp;ldquo;Shader quality&amp;rdquo; option. Setting this to low, should boost your FPS by quite a bit.</description></item><item><title>Player Camera</title><link>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/player-camera/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:22:50 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/player-camera/</guid><description>The two main cameras people play with in Fullspeed is either Camera 1 (Overview Camera) or Camera 2 (Follow Camera).
Camera 1 sits a bit higher and gives sort of an overview of the car. It lags a bit behind the directional vector of your car which makes it a very useful camera for jumps and some other styles like ICE where you drive sideways. Many use this camera in fullspeed as it gives a more consistent overview.</description></item><item><title>Custom Skid Marks</title><link>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/custom-skid-marks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:22:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://fsfam.club/resources/game-setup/custom-skid-marks/</guid><description>TrackMania allows you to override certain textures in the game by creating some folders that the game actively looks for.

[{"content":"What is TrackMania and a “track/play style” in the game? TrackMania a game that is quite simple to understand. You control a car that is placed at the start line of a track, and your only inputs are forward, backwards and left/right steering. Every car is the same, they behave, accelerate, break all the same. The track gives you a route, and your goal is to drive to the finish line as fast as possible. Sounds quite simple, right?\nNot so fast (pun intended)! Once you start playing the game, you should quickly realize that there must be something you are doing wrong when you are unable to get anywhere close to the fastest times. Maybe on some tracks, you are closer to the fastest times than some other tracks. But in general, you can’t get those times no matter what you try.\nMaybe you even start watching replays of faster runs and try to understand them. Your lines seem all similar and you have no clue what is going on. This is what is making TrackMania special. Because when you dive deep into the game, you start realizing the immense depth it provides and with that comes an insanely high skill ceiling.\nThis game depth provides so many different details, so many tricks, so many lines and track features that people started categorizing them into styles. Each style usually feature certain track features and gameplay tricks.\nThe most popular styles we have in the game, which we like to call the main styles are Tech, Dirt, Ice, RPG/Trial, Fullspeed and Mixed. Most players in this game have their favorite style and may also consider that as their main. Mixed is a style that incorporates multiple specialized styles in one track and is mostly used in the highest competitions.\nEach of the styles have their perks and should all be learned. Because if you know one style, it is not that hard to get into another with a bit of effort. In fact, knowing one style can even help you improve in another.\nThat said, there is one popular style that a big part of the community loves to drive. It is the ultimate style of speed, wicked transitions and rollercoasters elements. This is Fullspeed and the style we will teach you about in this guide.\nTrackMania provides an immense depth to the game. This depth provides so many different details, so many tricks, so many lines and track features that people started categorizing them into styles. Each style usually feature certain track features and gameplay tricks. Fullspeed is one of those styles that features speed, wicked transitions and rollercoaster elements.\nWhat is Fullspeed? So what separates Fullspeed from the other styles? Well as I said earlier, the most prominent feature of Fullspeed is speed. Fullspeed tracks tends to feature speeds well above 400. Most Fullspeed tracks lie between the 500-800 speed range.\nBut obviously, you can reach these types of speeds in other types of tracks than Fullspeed. So why is Fullspeed so special?\nWell, as the name implies, the main thing in Fullspeed is that you are driving the track in full speed. What this means is; no breaking, no releasing of the accelerator, you don’t drift to slow down and you don’t crash. If you can drive the entire track through the intended route while doing those 4 things, the track is considered to be a Fullspeed track.\nEssentially, Fullspeed is about maintaining speed. You use this speed to gain more speed, and the speed you gained from that to gain even more speed. Fullspeed is a very momentum based style, and typically, the goal is to snowball the speed throughout the entire track. Anything that either keeps your speed or gains more speed is good. And anything that slows you down is bad.\nCertain track features like loops, wallrides, tubes etc. may slow you down. But that doesn’t mean it’s not Fullspeed, these are simply track features intended to be a problem for you to solve by losing as little speed as possible. If you for example drift or break, you don’t follow the concept of losing as little speed as possible.\nThere is, however a certain trick in Fullspeed called S4D where you break to start a speed drift. This is the ONLY exception for when breaking is accepted. It is simply a small tap on the break to start a speed drift in other to gain even more speed. The reason this is still accepted is that it is a trick to gain speed.\nIf you can drive through the entire track without breaking, releasing, crashing or drifting to slow down, on any surface, the map is considered to be Fullspeed.\nIf you do a drift to slow down in order to manage a turn, then you are not really doing something to gain more speed, you are simply slowing down to do a faster line, this is not Fullspeed. Which brings us to the next point.\nWhat is not Fullspeed? Many people think that if you hold the accelerator through the entire track and don’t break, the track is Fullspeed. As I explained earlier, it is possible to drift without breaking and always holding the accelerator. But if you do this to slow down to be able to get through a turn, you are NOT driving the track full speed.\nThe rules on what Fullspeed is applies to all surfaces, whether it is asphalt, dirt, grass, ice etc. It does not matter if you have to slow down in a way to manage the track.\n“Grass Fullspeed” is a popular style in Track Of The Day, but in most of these tracks, you have to drift on the grass, slowing down in order to make a turn. Contra to many people’s belief, this is not actually Fullspeed. Those tracks are simply a fast track where you don’t release the accelerator.\nThere are actually sub-styles for these “almost fullspeed” tracks. And they even used to have a very active community back in the day in the form of SpeedFun and FunSpeed. You can read more about the differences of the “speed” styles on this TrackMania Wiki page.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"What Fullspeed is and isn't","uri":"/basics/what-is-fullspeed/"},{"content":"The most common input devices used in Fullspeed are keyboard and gamepad/controller. What you use typically does not matter. There are top players that use both keyboard and gamepad, who are all very consistent and can drive very fast times.\nWhen chosing an input device for fullspeed, you should go with the one you feel the most comfortable with.\nWhile the differences between keyboard and gamepad are neglectible in practice, there are a few differences that are worth knowing about.\nDifferences between keyboard and gamepad/controller in Fullspeed Obviously, the most noticable difference is the fact that gamepad gives you control over the entire steering movement while keyboard is either fullsteering or no steering.\nThis means, for example when speed drifting, you can hold the desired overlap the entire way at the exact point with gamepad. While on keyboard, you wil have to find a certain tapping rythm that gives an approximate of the desired overlap.\nThis may sound like gamepad is much better for speed drifting. But in practice, it turns out that keyboard is more consistent. The reason for this is that it is much easier to find a tapping rythm and keep it. When tapping you are also more consistently going out and in of the perfect overlap. On gamepad, it is practically impossible to keep the perfect overlap the entire way, it’s usually almost perfect, very rarely perfect.\nSo on keyboard you are going between almost perfect and perfect in a consistent rythm, while on gamepad you are almost perfect the entire way. You can then imagine that it is generally easier to be consistent with speed drifting on keyboard. However, just because you use a gamepad doesn’t mean you need to hold the SD. This inconsistency with gamepad can also be solved by doing a tapping rythm with the stick, essentially creating the same effect as on keyboard.\nAnother difference between the analog and binary input is that the more you steer, the more forward momentum you lose. This is more prominent in the start of maps or in lower speeds. Therefore, smooth steering around turns actually gives you a tiny bit more acceleration. You can also get around this issue by using action keys on keyboard.\nBecause you have more control over the steering on gamepad, it is also generally easier to drive precise parts on the maps. You can also be very precise on keyboard, but this requires more practice in general. However, it is typically easier to control the car on keyboard as the input is much more instant.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Input Device","uri":"/game-setup/input-device/"},{"content":"Chapter 1 Game Setup Optimizing your game can help you get a more pleasurable experience while playing Fullspeed and Trackmania in general.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Game Setup","uri":"/game-setup/"},{"content":"Speed is propotional to time. The more speed you have, the less time is needed to move from point A to point B. In Fullspeed, your speed is almost the deterministic factor for how well you are driving and the final result. Because you don’t slow down in Fullspeed, you can think of the track as 1 big straight line, and the more speed you have the faster you get to the finish.\nTherefore, you should spend most of your time perfecting ways to maintain and obtain speed in Fullspeed tracks. But before we look into ways to do this, let’s look a bit on how you can check this speed.\nSpeed Checking No, this is not about creating jumps that only work for certain speeds. This is about looking at your speed at strategical positions throughout the track to determine, first of all; how well you are currently driving the track, but also, it is also a good way to learn and get feedback on what you did.\nWhen experimenting and trying to figure out the best lines, the number one metric for this is your speed. For that reason, you will get a huge advantage by making yourself the habit of always looking at your speed. This is not easy to implement ofcourse. The best way to incorporate this into your driving is simply to always force yourself to do it, even if you think you don’t have to. The earlier you begin with checking speeds and get it in as a habit, the more beneficial it will be for you.\nCommon places to check speeds There is no real answer to where the best place to check speeds are as most tracks have unique spots. However, there are some common spots that you can use to get started with speed checking.\nIn most spots, you check your speed where it stops changing for a split second, as it gives you a much easier reading. Depending on the period the speed freezes for, you may have to practice a bit if the period is very low.\nJumps When you drive off a ramp, the speed stops for a bit, this is a very good place to check your speed.\nIn the example video below, we check our speed when the car leaves the ramp. In this case the speed is 510. You can compare this speed when jump again in a next run and see if you have more or less speed.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Quarterpipes When you drive into a quarter pipe, whether it is a turnover, wallride or tube entry, the speed freezes for a split second as you hit the quarter pipe. Features like wallrides, turnovers and tubes typically starts with a quarterpipe. You can see below in the videos how the speed freezes for a small moment when you drive into the quarter pipes. It doesn’t matter how you hit the quarter pipes, the speed always freezes for a bit, whether you drive straight on or in an angle.\nWallrides In both the entry and exit of wallrides, the speed freezes for a short while where you can check your speed. The entry speed is useful for knowing if you did the section before the wallride well, and the exit speed is good for knowing how well you did the wallride itself.\nIn this example speed is 479 on the entry and 455 on the exit. You normally check the speed earlier on the entry of wallrides than on the exit as that is when the speed stops and it is possible to see it.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Turnovers When entering a turnover, you hit a quarterpipe most of the time, that is a good place to check your speed. However, when you reach the top of the turnover, the speed stops for a split second. The speed you see at the top is more important than the speed you enter the turnover with. This is because it determines your exit speed, which is what you will use for the rest of the track. We will give you more details on how the speed works in turnovers in the later chapters.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Tubes Often you check your speed when going up into a tube, as well as at the top of the tube. These are two points where the speed freezes for a split second. When going up in a tube, you wan’t to read the highest speed that you got. When you are at the top of the tube, it is the opposite, count the lowest speed you see on your speedometer.\nHere in the example video we are entering the tube with a speed of 652, and when we reach the top the speed is at 607 on the lowest.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Elevation Since gravity pull you down, you can imagine that when driving upwards you accelerate less, and driving downwards accelerates you faster. This is the same for anything that is not flat ground. When driving through a tube, you can see that as you go up into the tube, you lose acceleration and gain acceleration when driving downwards.\nWhile we will get more into what a tube is and how to drive it later, you can for now, just try to drive up a hill and down a hill to see for yourself how the speed changes. This can give you a better intuition on how elevation affects your speed.\nSpeed Drifting Speed drifting is an advanced technique that allows you to accelerate faster than usual. However, speed drifting is a more advanced technique that is used in combination with all the basic techniques of not losing speed. We will look into speed drifting later, but for now, you should not think about it at all. In the next pages, we will guide you through some basic techniques for keeping as much speed as possible.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Your Speed","uri":"/basics/your-speed/"},{"content":"Chapter 2 Fullspeed Basics You have now gone through an introduction, watched a video, know how to approach fullspeed and optimized your game for Fullspeed! It is now time for the fun part, so let’s dive into actually learning Fullspeed!\nThe guide is comprised into 4 main sections. We will start with the absolute basics and guide you through everything you need to know to master the Fullspeed style.\nThis first section assumes little to no game knowledge about TrackMania, which makes this a perfect start for any new-comers. We will also go over a few details that you may not have picked up even if you are a bit more experience already.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Fullspeed Basics","uri":"/basics/"},{"content":"Since Fullspeed is such a high-speed and intensive style to play, having good frame rate will be quite important as it helps with reaction times and seeing what is coming at you in the track.\nInfo Under Settings -\u003e Graphics you will find all settings related to the graphics of the game.\nShader Quality One of the most impactful options on your FPS is the “Shader quality” option. Setting this to low, should boost your FPS by quite a bit. However, there is an important thing to consider in Fullspeed with this option. The lower this option is, the more transparent your skid marks will be. This can be annoying when it comes to speed drifting as you typically need to see the exact overlap. However, there is a solution to this problem below under Custom Skid Marks.\nResolution There are typically two ways to set the resolution, either to your monitor’s settings or 4:3 stretched. This is again up to you and what you prefer. Some Fullspeed players prefer stretched as it makes speed drifting a bit more accurate.\nMotion Blur Motion blur can make it difficult to see what is happening as edges will be blurred when you are at speed. It is recommended to turn this off while playing Fullspeed.\nGraphics Quality Most of the graphics quality options does not impact the perfomance that much. If you struggle with FPS, you can turn all of them down. Bloom, lens flare and reflections can in some cases blow up and reduce visibility and it can be a good idea to turn them down for Fullspeed.\nFPS Settings It is recommended to set your maximum FPS to your monitor’s refresh rate. This can limit the amount of resources the game uses and lighten up your cpu for other important tasks. For example while streaming, it can be a good idea to limit the FPS to prevent lag. If you always have more than enough FPS while playing the game, it is also possible to enable the V-Sync option at the bottom. However, this option tends to be laggy if you already struggle with FPS.\nSynchronization In some cases, you can tune the GPU \u0026 CPU synchronization at the bottom to improve your frames. There is no real answer to what is best here, as it depends on your system. Turning it off or enabling it can have both effects. We suggest you play around with it.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Graphics","uri":"/game-setup/graphics/"},{"content":"The previous page talks about how important speed is in Fullspeed. So how do we actually gain and maintain speed? Well, as you can imagine, your car can only accelerate if your wheels are on the ground, have grip and you hold the forward acceleration button. So if your wheels lifts off from the ground and are in the air, or lose grip on the surface, you can’t really accelerate anymore.\nThe concept of grip management is quite simple; on the surface you are driving on, you either have grip or not. However, it becomes a complex skill when we have multiple types of surfaces, the ground isnt flat anymore and we start driving in loops, tubes, wallrides or other vertical features.\nWe will talk more about grip management in the later chapters when we get to the different Fullspeed features. But for now, let’s give you an introduction to the most basic type of grip management: avoiding drifts.\nThe speed loss of drifting When you are drifting/sliding below 420 speed or not doing a speed drift (an advanced technique we will talk about later, so ignore this for now), you will not accelerate as fast anymore. In fact, most of the time, there will be a negative acceleration. This can give a huge impact on your speed and may lose you seconds in a Fullspeed track.\nWhen you drive Fullspeed, the best way to avoid drifting too much is to smoothen your steering inputs. Drive the track smoothly, as much forward as possible, avoid sudden and hard steering inputs. This may be very difficult for a beginner, but the best way to get better at smooth driving is to get used to planning a head of time. Think about what is coming next, how different approaches will affect your line. The more you practice this, the better you get and you will automatically become faster in general by just driving more smoothly.\nIf you have below 420 in speed, you should avoid all kinds of drifting as it will most likely slow you down. But when you are above 420, the most important thing to consider is to avoid full drifting.\nAs an example, this video illustrates how bad drifting can be in Fullspeed: There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. You can see how much more speed the car that isn’t drifting compared to the car that is drifting. This gives a huge lead by the end. In real fullspeed tracks that are much longer than the one in the example video, this small drift can be the difference of seconds by the end of the track.\nDifferent drifting types A full drift occurs when your drifting angle is so high that you see 4 skid marks behind your car. When the skids of your front and back wheels overlap while driving more than 420 km/h, this is called a speed drift. When your back and front wheels overlap completely, it is called a noslide. Only the second option will not lose speed.\nTo help illustrate what I mean by these different types of drifting, check out this image:\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Grip Management","uri":"/basics/grip-management/"},{"content":"Chapter 3 Introduction to Fullspeed Features WIP\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Intro to Fullspeed Features","uri":"/intro-to-fullspeed-features/"},{"content":" Info You can find settings related to camera under Settings -\u003e Interface -\u003e Miscellaneous.\nThe two main cameras people play with in Fullspeed is either Camera 1 (Overview Camera) or Camera 2 (Follow Camera).\nCamera 1 sits a bit higher and gives sort of an overview of the car. It lags a bit behind the directional vector of your car which makes it a very useful camera for jumps and some other styles like ICE where you drive sideways. Many use this camera in fullspeed as it gives a more consistent overview. However, it tends to have issues with visibility in places where you drive downwards since the camera angle is always fixed. It is also sometimes difficult to see the speed in the back of your car when driving uphill.\nCamera 2 sits more behind your car. It always changes the angle depending on the directional vector of your car. Whether you drive downhill or uphill, or are even in a full vertical position. The camera is always the same relative to your car. Because of this, Camera 2 does not have the problems that Camera 1 faces when driving downhill or uphill. You will always be able to see your speed.\nThere are many different opinions on what camera is the best for Fullspeed. In theory, Camera 2 seems to be the Camera most suited for Fullspeed styled tracks. However, in the end, it is always a matter of preference and we suggest to use what you are the most comfortable with.\nCamera 3/Cockpit View Camera 3 is the camera that is positioned within the cockpit of your car. This is mostly used when driving rollercoaster elements or in vertical positions as it gives you a much better view of what is coming ahead. You can change the look of this camera depending on your preference.\nUnder SETTINGS -\u003e INTERFACE -\u003e MISCELLANEOUS you can find options for your player camera. There are 3 options that you can consider using.\nPrioritize alternate cockpit view - If you enable this, the car will not be shown in Camera 3. This gives you even more visibility, however the speedometer will now be gone and you can no longer check your speed. However, there are plugins in Openplanet (see below) that solves this issue. Player visibility for cockput view: Opaque - This option shows the car and speed with no transparency. Player visibility for cockput view: Transparent - This should be the best option for Fullspeed players. It shows the car, but in a transparent way so you have the full visibility of what is in front of you. But more important, it also shows the speedometer.

The essential element of Fullspeed is the speed and momentum that you build up through the track until the finish line.\nThe speed you accumulate in different sections of the tracks snowballs throughout the entire track, giving players an incredible amount of speed, sometimes even reaching the absolute maximum amount of speed the car can drive.\nBefore you continue reading on in this guide, we highly recommend you watch this amazing 57 minute documentary of Fullspeed by Veritas:\nHow to Approach Fullspeed While playing Fullspeed it can be quite de-motivating when you feel like you drive the map well and is taking the same lines as the top players, but you’re still 1-2 seconds behind their final times.\nBecause of how momentum based the style is, even the smallest differences can give a huge impact by the time you reach the end of the track. You should realize that the time differences doesn’t always mean you did a bad run. But rather think about the small tiny differences the way you play the track compared to the top players.\nFullspeed is a style where the tinest of details matter, and with so many small details to consider, the impact they make can be huge when summed up together. These details can be overwhelming for beginners. I suggest therefore to take everything progressively. Focus first on driving the maps smooth, take the shortest paths and avoid sliding too much. Getting these 3 things down will already give you a huge advantage.\nWhen playing Fullspeed, focus on the details but avoid overcomplicating. Drive more direct lines. Fullspeed is about driving everything as smooth as possible, which usually means minimizing the amount of steering you do. It’s sort of like simplifying everything to avoid as much steering as possible.\nSometimes the weirdest lines are the fastest ways to approach a section in a fullspeed track. These are not very obvious. When figuring out a map, try different approaches, different , even try stuff that doesn’t seem to be the best way. This gives you a much better understanding of the map and fullspeed in general than just copying other’s lines.\nSince fullspeed is all about momentum and snowballing your speed throughout the entire map, the speed is your number one metric for how well you are driving the different sections. Get used to keep an eye on your speed throughout the entire map.\nBest Ways to Practice First of all, play the game and have fun. The best way to improve on fullspeed is to find the maps you enjoy and play them alot.\nDriving fullspeed is alot about a good combination of intuition and muscle memory. You gain inutition by playing alot of maps, experimenting, trying things and failing, just generally expose yourself to as many different scenarios as possible. Muscle memory comes from repetition, playing the same sections or maps over and over.\nBecause of this, you should not just do one thing, like don’t just play on online servers, or don’t just hunt a single map the whole day. Give yourself some variety, play a bunch of maps online, hunt a map for a few hours, open the editor and create something to practice over and over until you get it or discover new techniques.\nImproving on fullspeed is all about your own effort, whenever you play, get into the mindset of constantly asking the questions “what went right here?” and “what went wrong here?”.\nCompetitions can be one of the best ways to improve on fullspeed. They give you a goal that to go for, you connect with the community and it is generally a fun way to engage with the game.\nMotivation is also an important factor, forget trying to reach the top players, but instead set yourself small goals like improving your PB by .1 on a map. Improve from yourself, not others.\nSo what do you focus on when practicing fullspeed? Your speed. Get an understanding of how you lose and gain speed, as well as how fast you accelerate. Learn how even speed affects itself. For example driving up a hill decreases your acceleration, but with more speed, you reach the top faster, and can accelerate again quicker, giving you the snowball effect of just accelerating your speed even more.\nIn fullspeed, you want to generally practice things that gives you the most acceleration and speed or least speed loss.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Fullspeed","uri":"/"},{"content":"Overlap Percentages per Surface The following table shows the approximately how much you need to overlap your skid marks on flat ground. Remember that the amount of overlap changes depending on the elevation you drive in. You can use these overlaps as the base overlap for everything.\nObviously, plastic does not have visible skid marks, you’ll have to feel or imagine the overlap you currently have for this to work.\nSpeed Asphalt (Overlap) Dirt (Overlap) Grass (Overlap) Plastic (Overlap) 220 - 80% 83% 83% 300 - 85% 88% 88% 400 - 87% 90% 90% 420 50% - - - 500 60% 90% 92% 92% 600 67% 92% 93% 93% 700 72% 93% 94% 94% 795 - - 95% - 800 75% 94% - 95% 895 - 94% - 900 78% - - 95% 995 80% - - 96% Visual: Asphalt/Tarmac Visual: Dirt Visual: Grass Relationship between overlap and acceleration For any given speed, you accelerate a certain amount when driving straight without drifting. This usually depends on which gear you are in, except after 800 where the acceleration drops to 3.6. We call this the base acceleration. If you were to initiate a speed drift, you get a boost on this base acceleration.\nDepending on the overlap of the skid marks, this acceleration becomes better and better until you reach the optimal overlap for the current speed. However, if you overlap more than the optimal overlap, your acceleration boost will begin to decrease instead.\nThe graph above shows the generic behavior of the relationship between skid overlap and acceleration. The Y axis is the acceleration, and the X axis is the overlap, with more overlap to the left and less overlap to the right. The gray straight line in the middle is the base acceleration for a given speed.\nIf you were to drift, the black line shows the acceleration boost relative to the base speed that you get. As you can see, with too much overlap (under sliding) or too little overlap (over sliding) you will get either less additional acceleration or even less acceleration to begin with.\nAn important practical note is that if you notice the black graph is much steeper on the left side than on the right side. The goal is of course to keep your skid overlap in a way that you are always at the top of the black graph, but this is simply not practical and requires extreme precision. But you can imagine that you have much more room to work with on the right side, or in other words if you are over sliding. Therefore, if you are unsure about the overlap required for some speed, it is better to over slide than under slide.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Skids Overlap","uri":"/speed-drifting/skids-overlap/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/categories/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"/tags/"}]

# Speed Drifting

Now that you've learned the basic concepts and features present in fullspeed it's time to go over Speed Drifts.

Speed Drifting, Speedsliding or SD for short is the fundamental mechanic to gain speed in fullspeed tracks. A Speed Drift is when you slide in specific angles to increase the car's acceleration, we will learn more about these angles later on [Skids Overlap](https://fsfam.club/resources/speed-drifting/skids-overlap/).

A Speed drift can be performed in multiple surfaces most commonly: Road, dirt, grass and plastic, with the optimal overlap varying between these surfaces.

You can benefit from the increased acceleration of speed drifting from 420 speed and above, with this technique being especially important at 800+ speed, when the regular acceleration of the car becomes significantly lower.

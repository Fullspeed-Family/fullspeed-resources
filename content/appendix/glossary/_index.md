##### Galaxy Drift (GD)
A galaxy drift is a technique for speed drifting down an upside-down quarterpipe. In some cases, you can also SD upwards in a quarterpipe (eg. in a turnover). It is usually done by first losing grip and then steer hard to initiate an SD down the quarterpipe. It only works at 800+ in tubes, pancakes, turnovers and other features that allow such conditions. The technique was named after Mariogalaxy who discovered it.

##### Hunter Wall
A hunter wall is a wall to banked transition, also refered to as a feature. It is commonly used in many advanced tracks to create more interesting features. Hunter walls are named after the player and mapper "Hunter", who popularized these transitions.

##### Memebounce
Memebounce is a trick where you force your car to land with your back wheels on a bump in the road. This gives a nose-dive rotation in a way that you keep your wheels on the ground the entire time. It is used to lower air time.

##### Midroad Bug

##### Nose-dive
A nosedive is a state in which the front of your car starts pointing downwards. In some cases it can be forced in order to get lower air time.

##### Reverse Turnover
A reverse turnover explains itself really, you enter a normal turnover in reverse. This is typically done by having magnets at the top to avoid losing grip.

##### Ride Trick
The ride trick is a technique where you do a left-right or right-left steering motion right before a jump in order to tilt your car, and sometimes also get a slight nose-dive. Used to reduce air time.

##### Pancake
A pancake is a feature that may remind you of a cake, but has a flat top part instead of it being rounded. It also looks like an angled turnover. The pancake requires free-blocking other half and can be rotated by different amounts. A magnet at the top is used to strengthen the grip of the car to make the feature smoother.

##### SD (Speed Drift)
Stands for Speed Drift and is a technique to accelerate faster than you normally could. It is recognized by overlapping the front and back skid marks from the wheels during a drift. Works at 420+ speed on tarmac, and 220+ speed on the other surfaces.

##### Speed Limit
Speed limit usually refers to the state where your car is limited to 800 speed due to acceleration decreasing drastically at 800+. This can happen due to grass patches or being close to 800 as you enter a feature.

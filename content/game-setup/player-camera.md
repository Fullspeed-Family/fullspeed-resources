The two main cameras people play with in Fullspeed is either Camera 1 (Overview Camera) or Camera 2 (Follow Camera).

Camera 1 sits a bit higher and gives sort of an overview of the car. It lags a bit behind the directional vector of your car which makes it a very useful camera for jumps and some other styles like ICE where you drive sideways. Many use this camera in fullspeed as it gives a more consistent overview. However, it tends to have issues with visibility in places where you drive downwards since the camera angle is always fixed. It is also sometimes difficult to see the speed in the back of your car when driving uphill.

Camera 2 sits more behind your car. It always changes the angle depending on the directional vector of your car. Whether you drive downhill or uphill, or are even in a full vertical position. The camera is always the same relative to your car. Because of this, Camera 2 does not have the problems that Camera 1 faces when driving downhill or uphill. You will always be able to see your speed.

There are many different opinions on what camera is the best for Fullspeed. In theory, Camera 2 seems to be the Camera most suited for Fullspeed styled tracks. However, in the end, it is always a matter of preference and we suggest to use what you are the most comfortable with.

## Camera 3/Cockpit View
Camera 3 is the camera that is positioned within the cockpit of your car. This is mostly used when driving rollercoaster elements or in vertical positions as it gives you a much better view of what is coming ahead. You can change the look of this camera depending on your preference.

Under `SETTINGS -> INTERFACE -> MISCELLANEOUS` you can find options for your player camera. There are 3 options that you can consider using.

- **Prioritize alternate cockpit view** - If you enable this, the car will not be shown in Camera 3. This gives you even more visibility, however the speedometer will now be gone and you can no longer check your speed. However, there are plugins in Openplanet (see below) that solves this issue.
- **Player visibility for cockput view: Opaque** - This option shows the car and speed with no transparency.
- **Player visibility for cockput view: Transparent** - This should be the best option for Fullspeed players. It shows the car, but in a transparent way so you have the full visibility of what is in front of you. But more important, it also shows the speedometer.

# Introduction to Fullspeed Features

When you drive a Fullspeed map, you will encounter sections within the map where you have to drive up into something that can remind you of something out of a rollercoaster. For example a loop, or vertically on a wall. Maybe you have attempted to get through something that just seems to defy all laws of physics.

One characteristic element that many Fullspeed features has is that you drive up into it and end up in some kind of vertical position, or even upside-down.

In the next chapter, we will go through the basic features that occurs the most, and which gives the groundwork for moving onto more advanced features.

This chapter is written in an analytic fashion, to give you a detailed understanding of how the features work, and tips on what to keep in mind when encountering them.
